## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Streamlit web interface
- **Backend**: Original RAG system with LangGraph workflow
- **Vector Store**: ChromaDB for document embeddings and memory
- **LLM**: Mistral AI for response generation and quiz creation
- **Document Processing**: LangChain for PDF and text processing

### File Structure
```
â”œâ”€â”€ streamlit_app.py          # Main Streamlit interface
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py                   # Original RAG assistant logic
â”œâ”€â”€ vector_store_manager.py   # Vector store management
â”œâ”€â”€ document_processor.py     # Document processing utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ upload_service.py         # File upload and processing
â”œâ”€â”€ graph_nodes.py           # LangGraph workflow nodes
â”œâ”€â”€ config.py                # Configuration settings
â”œâ”€â”€ run_streamlit.bat        # Windows batch file to start app
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                     # Environment variables (create this)
â”œâ”€â”€ uploads/                 # Directory for uploaded files
â”œâ”€â”€ chroma_storage/          # ChromaDB memory storage
â””â”€â”€ kb_storage/              # ChromaDB knowledge base storage
```

### Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file in the project directory with:
```
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key_here
```

## Original Functionality Preserved
All original functionality from the command-line version is preserved:
- Document processing and chunking
- Vector store management
- Memory persistence
- Quiz generation
- Knowledge retrieval
- Context-aware responses

The Streamlit interface is a wrapper that provides a user-friendly way to access all these features without changing the underlying logic.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Port already in use**: If port 8501 is busy, Streamlit will automatically try the next available port
2. **Missing API key**: Ensure your `.env` file contains a valid `MISTRAL_API_KEY`
3. **Upload errors**: Check that the uploads directory exists and has proper permissions
4. **Memory issues**: Large documents may take time to process; wait for the spinner to complete
